# Duckie Lab

## Prerequisites

- Duckiebot 
- Laptop with VS Code and  the Docker and Dev Container extensions
- Laptop and the Duckiebot must be connected to the same network:

        SSID: robo-duckie, PSK: entenhausen

## Instructions

### Setup SSH
1. Create a ssh key pair 

   - **Windows**:  
        - Install [Putty Key Generator](https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/%7Esgtatham/putty/latest.html) and run it
        - Click on `Generate`
        - Save the public and private keys on your computer in your `C:\Users\Username\.ssh` folder as `id_rsa.pub` and `id_rsa`
   - **Mac / Linux**:  
        -  `ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "email@example.com"`
        - Press enter to save the key pair in default location
        - Do not use a passphrase

2. Copy your public key to the duckiebot:

   - **Windows**:
        - Enter the following command in your command shell
        
              type %USERPROFILE%\.ssh\id_rsa.pub | ssh duckie@DUCKIE_NAME.local "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"` 

          replace `DUCKIE_NAME` with `alpha` for example

   - **Mac / Linux**:
        - Enter the following command in your command shell
  
              ssh-copy-id duckie@DUCKIE_NAME.local
             
          replace `DUCKIE_NAME` with `alpha` for example

### Setup VS Code

1. Configure Docker Environment in VS Code.

   Open VS Code and

   - **Windows**: navigate to **File** > **Preferences** > **Settings** > **Docker Environment**.
   
   - **Mac**: click on the **Manage** icon (located in the lower-left corner) > **Settings** > **Docker** > **Docker: Environment**.

    Add the following entry:
   - `DOCKER_HOST`: `ssh://duckie@ROBOT_NAME.local`
   - Replace `ROBOT_NAME` with your robotâ€™s name, e.g., `alpha`.

1. Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) to issue the `Docker Contexts: Use` command to activate the `default` Docker context. 


### Start Remote Development
1. In VS Code, open the `docker-compose.yml` file and add your intials to the service name `ros` in line 2 (e.g. `ros-fh`).
1. Right-click on `docker-compose.yml` and start it by selecting `Docker compose up`. This will create a new container on the duckiebot (its Nvidia Jetson Nano).

1. Press `F1` and type `Dev Containers: Attach to running container` and chose the container `/duckie_lab-ros-fh` with your initials.

1. In the new VS Code window, you will see on the bottom left something like `Container duckie_lab-ros`. 

1. Have a look at the python files in `/code/catkin_ws/src/duckie-lab/src/`, for example `camera_subscriber.py`. Change the variable `robot_name` to the name of your robot. 

1. Run the python code of the `camera_subscriber.py` in the terminal 

        rosrun duckie_lab camera_subscriber.py

   **Warning**: The code in the `/code/catkin_ws/src/duckie-lab` folder is shared with your duckie robot as a docker volume, but not with your computer. In order to prevent code loss, use a proper version control to back up your code frequently!


## Troubleshooting

**Problem**: *The error code appears: "Error response from daemon: client version 1.47 is too new"*
1. In VS Code, navigate to the settings "Docker Environment" and add the following entry:

   `DOCKER_API_VERSION` value: `1.41`


**Problem**: *I can't launch the Python node.*
        
1. Make sure the python file is executable. In a terminal, type

        chmod +x camera_subscriber.py

2. Make sure the workspace is built

        cd /code/catkin_ws && catkin build

3. Make sure the workspace is sourced:

        source /code/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

**Problem**: *I have installed some PIP packages in the container, but they are lost.*

+ After you have used the container it is recommended to stop the container (not compose down).
If you use the compose down command the container will be deleted,
and you will lose all the pip packages etc. you have installed.

**Problem**: *I want to use the Duckiebot at home with my home network.*

+ You need to connect to your duckiebot while connected to the `robo-duckie` network:

        ssh duckie@ROBOTNAME.local

+ The password is `quackquack` by default.

+ Add the SSID and password of your home network by modifying the a configuration file:

        sudo sed -i 's/yourhomenetwork/MYSSID/g' /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf 
        sudo sed -i 's/password/MYPASSWORD/g' /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf

   Replace `MYSSID` and `MYPASSWORD` with the correct ssid and password of your home network.
